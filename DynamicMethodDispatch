/*Dynamic Method Dispatch
 * When we have same method in both classes then it overrides and prints method in sub class
 * But when we create object for all the classes then we get both methods.
 * This process is called Dynamic Method Dispatch which is run time polymorphism ie output is known 
 * after it is runned.
 * 
 * A obj=new B(); Here A is type and new B() is object creation
 * Object creation doesnot depend on type.So it creates object for B only
